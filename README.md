# Quality-Analysis

Quality analysis is one of the major aspects in software development and maintenance. Quality analysis and assurance gives high quality end products and customer satisfaction.

## Few factors that attribute to the importance of quality analysis are:

1. Better user experience: Quality analysis ensures that the end product or service is of high quality and thus assures a better user experience. All expected scenarios must be tested and handled appropriately and this must to check by the testing professionals to ensure a bug free application.
2. Increases Revenue: Proper quality analysis and testing increases revenue by saving on the cost of probable fixes.
3. Improved Brand Reputation: A good quality product always increases your brand reputation in a positive manner. This leads to new sales leads and projects, hence improving your business.
4. Increased repeat business: Satisfied customers also give you repeat business, if you have previously delivered a good quality and tightly tested product. This in turn increases your revenue and profits.

## Process 

Quality assurance (QA) is any systematic process of determining whether a product or service meets specified requirements. QA establishes and maintains set requirements for developing or manufacturing reliable products.

End to end is the process to analyze the set of interactions between customers and organizations throughout their relationship. The idea of providing this is to enhance the customer experience at each and every stage of customer's interaction with the organization.


### Q/A

1. What is product quality analysis ?
* It is a process of delivering the high quality products and services to costomers.

2. Different stages of product quality.
* In general there are three different types of product quality:
        1. Before Production: Company must findout the needes of the customers and the needs must include product design specification etc.
        2. Durning production: Company must have quality control at all the stages of there development.
        3. After production: Finished product must be verified by the client and make sure that the produce has develop based on the cilent needs.

3. Parameters of product quality:
```
1. preformance
2. Features
3. Reliability
4. Conformance
5. Durability
6. Servicability
7. Aesthetics
8. Perceived Quality
```


## In this data i am working on checking the quality of wine based on thee following parameters:

1. fixed acidity : most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)
2. volatile acidity : the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste
3. citric acid : found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines
4. residual sugar : the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet
5. chlorides : the amount of salt in the wine
6. free sulfur dioxide : the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
7. total sulfur dioxide : amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine,but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine
8. density : the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content
9. pH : describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale
10. sulphates : a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
